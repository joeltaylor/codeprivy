My name is Joel.

I'm a software engineer and continual learner. 

These days, I work over at [Code School](http://codeschool.com) where I spend most of my time maintaining a large Rails application and implementing new features. In addition, I authored a course on [MongoDB](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/the-magical-marvels-of-mongodb).

I'm currently a contributor and maintainer for [JavaScript.com](http://JavaScript.com) -  an open source resource.

For me, learning has never stopped and I don't plan to slow down my self betterment. I love sitting down to learn a new technology or explore a topic I don't yet grasp. 

These days, my free time has been spent exploring machine learning and design patterns.

When I'm not behind the keyboard, I enjoy hammock camping, playing the banjo, and reading Russian literature.
