title: Getting Comfortable with Abstraction

I know I'm not alone when it comes to getting an "itch" whenever I come across unfamiliar code. Whether it's new syntax or confusing code, the mystery is just begging to be exposed.

I experienced this tension _a lot_ when I first started at Code School since the application was larger than anything I had worked with previously. Often times, I felt like I was living this comic -

I learned a lot by not accepting abstractions, but at the same time, following every abstraction isn't sustainable and balance is needed. Without balance, I'd easily end up in the Rails source code on a daily basis. There's a time to ask "why?" and a time to accept abstractions for face value.

I've developed some workflows to aid me in times that I feel that it's necessary for me to unveil the unknown. For things like new syntax, I'll pop open [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) to do a quick look up. I use Dash often and it's greatly increased my Ruby vocabulary. Granted, unknown syntax isn't an abstraction and I rarely ever let one escape my vendetta to understand the code I work with.

Getting familiar with your editor's search is also crucial. I use Vim and have Silver Searcher [setup](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/faster-grepping-in-vim) so that I can easily find the information I need. Sometimes, when working with a class, I need what I consider "minimal viable knowledge" of the abstraction so that I can understand how it collaborates with the code I'm working with. Get to know your editors search short cuts  and your mind will thank you.

Getting comfortable with abstractions has a lot to do with being OK with not understanding every part of an application. Just like most thing, sometimes you'll need to take it bit by bit.
