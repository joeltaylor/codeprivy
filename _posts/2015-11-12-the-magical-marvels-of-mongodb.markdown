For the past six months, I've had the honor of authoring a [course](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/the-magical-marvels-of-mongodb) for Code School on MongoDB. For a soft introduction to MongoDB, check out the [post](http://blog.codeschool.io/2015/10/28/conjuring-nosql-with-mongodb/) I wrote for the Code School blog.

One of the interesting dynamics of MongoDB is that, when I first searched for some perspective on it, I was met with a _boatload_ of negative blog posts. Most of them are rants, some are technical, and others are just bad use cases. Needless to say, it's easy to get caught up in the cruft. Reading blog posts on any technology can easily make you jaded and leave you questioning your sanity. [This](https://blog.nelhage.com/2015/11/what-mongodb-got-right/) blog post really captures the whole scenario.

One of the loudest questions that resonated in my mind while authoring the course was, "When do I use it?" If you find the same question pestering you, I'd recommend you check out [NoSQL Distilled](http://martinfowler.com/books/nosql.html) by Martin Fowler. I consider it to be one of most sound and applicable perspectives on the use case of NoSQL databases. Particularly, the concept of [polyglot persistence](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PolyglotPersistence.html) is one that I find promising and look forward to seeing its future.


I plan to write more on MongoDB. I like it.
